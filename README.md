# OpenCV (iOS & MacOS)

This repo contains OpenCV frameworks, compiled for iOS & macOS, as a single Podspec.

To use, just use the following in your podspec:
```
https://github.com/Fueled/OpenCV-iOS-macOS/blob/master/OpenCV.podspec
```
This will use the latest version available of OpenCV.

You can target a specific version, for example `4.5.1`:
```shell

```
